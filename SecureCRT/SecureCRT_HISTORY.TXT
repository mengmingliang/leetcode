    bar was reset to Default from the Menus tab in the Customize

    to the remote system from a script or a mapped key, they

  - In the Connect dialog, when a new folder was added, a folder
    called "New Folder" was also added.
  - In the Connect dialog, attempting to rename a session to the same

    already in use.
  - After pasting a copied session into a folder in the Connect
    dialog, the folder was selected.
  - SSH1: When SecureCRT was installed on a U3 drive, public-key
    authentication always failed for SSH1 sessions.

    MIT Kerberos DLL failed.

    SFTP tab became unresponsive.


Changes in SecureCRT 6.2 (Beta 2) -- February 17, 2009
------------------------------------------------------

Bug fixes:

  - Under Vista, selecting a file using "Zmodem Upload List..." from
    the Transfer menu caused SecureCRT to crash.
  - If the "Clear on disconnect" option was set and SecureCRT went
    into full screen mode after disconnecting from a session that
    had more than a page of output, SecureCRT crashed.
  - SecureCRT could crash after attempting to connect to a host that
    was not responding.
  - Under certain circumstances, SecureCRT could crash after
    scrolling back and then attempting to select some text.
  - If a session setting was changed in the Session Options dialog
    and then the Session Options dialog was re-opened, SecureCRT
    sometimes crashed.
  - If the X/Y/Zmodem upload and download folders did not exist and
    a Zmodem download was started and the "Browse for Folder" dialog
    was used after the transfer had timed out, SecureCRT crashed.
  - If the command line specified a path for a script, the script
    was not launched.
  - On a 64-bit machine, Help could not be launched.
  - With the "Retain size and font" option set, under certain
    circumstances, data displayed in the session window could not
    be selected.
  - If a Zmodem transfer was started and the download directory was
    not valid, if the "Browse for Folder" dialog was cancelled after
    the transfer timed out, garbage characters were sent to the
    server.
  - In the Connect dialog, if several sessions were selected and one
    was de-selected, when the mouse was right-clicked to display the
    context menu, the session was selected.
  - New color schemes added to an active session were not saved to
    the configuration file.
  - The 64-bit combined SecureCRT and SecureFX installer installed
    into the x86 location when run in silent mode.
  - In the installer, on the dialog that shows where the
    application is going to be installed, long install location
    paths were cut off.
  - The upgrade eligibility date displayed in the installer was not
    correct.


Changes in SecureCRT 6.2 (Beta 1) -- January 29, 2009
-----------------------------------------------------

New features:

  - A native 64-bit Windows version is available.
  - Multiple sessions can be selected and edited from the Connect
    dialog.  Only the changed fields will be applied to the
    selected sessions, which allows specific settings to be
    changed for a group of sessions.
  - There is a new option to remember which sessions were open the
    last time SecureCRT ran so that they can be launched the next
    time the application runs.
  - Added an option to create a new log file at midnight, which
    can be used to do automatic log rotation.
  - Added support for creating folders when a log file path is
    specified that does not already exist, which allows parameter
    substitutions to be used in folder names for log file paths.
  - Added a command-line parameter /LOG, which allows a log file to
    be specified on the command line.
  - A blank password can be used to lock a session, which makes it
    easier to prevent accidental typing in sessions.
  - SSH2: Added support for PKCS#11, allowing a Cryptographic Token
    Interface to be used for smart-card authentication.
  - SSH2: In the Activator, agent support has been enhanced by
    allowing keys to be explicitly added and removed.
  - SFTP: Added support for recursive remove (rm -r).
  - SFTP: Added support for the flags -a and -d to the ls and lls
    commands.

Changes:

  - Empty cells are not stored in the scrollback buffer, which in
    most cases, significantly reduces the amount of memory used by
    a session.
  - The default Maximum columns setting has been increased to 256.
  - The default download, upload, and public key generation folders
    have been changed to "My Documents".  Under Vista, the default
    download folder is the user's Download folder.  Only new
    installations are affected.
  - When SecureCRT and SecureFX are integrated, if the SecureFX
    button on the SecureCRT toolbar is pressed and the current
    session does not have a valid file transfer protocol
    specified, a more informative message is displayed.
  - Serial: Added support for changing the baud rate of a connected
    session.
  - SSH1/SSH2: Added support for specifying a password in the
    Session Options dialog.
  - SSH1/SSH2:  When creating an identity file, moving the mouse is
    no longer required to generate random data.

Bug fixes:

  - A script that called crt.Close immediately after calling
    crt.Screen.Send could cause SecureCRT to crash.
  - Connecting multiple sessions in tabs from a script sometimes did
    not work correctly and some sessions hung or did not connect.
  - If the first tabbed session used the vt100 font, a session
    that used UTF-8 encoding could not be cloned.
  - The terminal dimensions were not updated when tabs were dragged
    between windows of different dimensions.
  - After exiting a session of vi that changed the foreground and
    background colors, the foreground and background colors were not
    restored correctly.
  - In some cases, the scrollbar was in the wrong position after
    switching between tabbed sessions.
  - When downloading a file that contained an illegal character
    such as ":" using Zmodem or Ymodem, the file name was truncated
    at the illegal character.  Illegal characters are now replaced
    with "_".
  - If a firewall was specified on the command line and the firewall
    name contained a space, it was not used.
  - If the "Auto Save Options" setting was off and a value was
    changed in the Global Options dialog, if the Global Options
    dialog was re-opened, the change was not reflected in the
    dialog.
  - SecureCRT had to be restarted in order for changes made to the
    Default session to be honored in Quick Connect.
  - If a session was deleted while it was connected, the session was
    added to the session database after it was disconnected.
  - If the "Retain size and font" option was set and the window was
    resized, under certain circumstances, some lines did not have
    the correct background color.
  - If a firewall failed to connect and the "Auto reconnect" option
    was set, a new firewall authentication dialog was displayed
    every second.
